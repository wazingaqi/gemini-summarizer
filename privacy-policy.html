        <!-- the content goes here -->Privacy Policy for the "Gemini Summarizer" Chrome Extension
Effective Date: October 2024

Introduction
This privacy policy outlines how we handle and protect the information collected through the "Gemini Summarizer" Chrome Extension (the “Extension”). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting any data you may share with us. This policy explains what data the Extension collects, how it is used, and your rights regarding that data.

1. Information We Collect
The "Gemini Summarizer" extension is designed to summarize webpage content using Google's AI services. In doing so, the Extension may collect the following data:

Webpage Text Content: The Extension extracts text content from the active webpage you are viewing when you click the "Summarize" button. This content is used solely for the purpose of generating a summary.
API Interactions: The extracted text is sent to the Google Cloud Natural Language API for processing, where the summary is generated. This API interaction happens securely, and no additional data is collected or stored by us.
No Personal Data Collection
We do not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information (PII). The Extension does not access any user data other than the content of the webpage for summarization purposes.

2. How We Use the Information
The only use of the information collected by the Extension is to:

Extract the visible text content of the current webpage.
Send the extracted content to the Google Cloud Natural Language API to generate a summary.
Display the summary back to the user within the Extension’s popup interface.
3. Data Sharing
We do not share any data with third parties, except for interactions with the Google Cloud API to process the webpage content and generate a summary. The communication with Google's services follows their privacy and security standards.

Google Cloud: Any content processed by Google Cloud’s Natural Language API is subject to Google’s Privacy Policy.

4. Data Retention
We do not store any data collected from the webpages you summarize. Once the summary is displayed, the extracted text and summary are discarded. No data is stored locally or remotely by the Extension.

5. Security
We take security seriously and have implemented measures to ensure that any data processed through the Extension is handled securely:

The extension only runs when manually activated by the user.
All communication with external APIs, such as Google Cloud, is encrypted using industry-standard security protocols (HTTPS).
The Extension requests only the minimal permissions necessary for functionality (e.g., activeTab and scripting permissions).
6. Permissions
The Extension requires the following permissions:

activeTab: To interact with the currently active tab and retrieve webpage content for summarization.
scripting: To execute the script that extracts webpage content.
These permissions are necessary solely for the core functionality of the Extension and are only used when the user manually interacts with the Extension.

7. Your Choices
Data Control: You control when the Extension runs by manually activating it. The Extension does not run in the background or collect data without your explicit action.
Uninstallation: You can remove the "Gemini Summarizer" Extension at any time by going to Chrome’s Extensions settings and uninstalling it.
8. Changes to this Privacy Policy
We may update this privacy policy from time to time. If there are significant changes to how we handle your data, we will notify users via the Extension interface or an updated version in the Chrome Web Store.
